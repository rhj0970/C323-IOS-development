For our project, we've decided to create a virtual zoo video app. Due to CoronaVirus pandemic, almost every people are at stay-home order.
We've figured that some of kids or children want to go outside or go to zoo. So we decided to create a tableview app that contains
brief video of each animals (will use AVPlayer). This way, kids can watch animal through videos and have experience virtually.
