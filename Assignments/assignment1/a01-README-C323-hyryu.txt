From the assignment, I've done creating the guessingModel and functions inside the file. I've also created the design of the app, and connect all the label, buttons to viewController. One of the interesting part that we add is the restart button. Instead of using
key events, we decided to add the button so that user could restart the game. This way, it has better user-friendly design.

Are there any problems with your Team? None. It was a perfect team. One problem is that since we are the only team with 3 people,
I personally felt little bit challenging than other teams because we have to share workload of 3 instead of 4.
