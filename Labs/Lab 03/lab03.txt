I can see the color from SceneDidBecomeActive in the simulator, when I first start the app
I can see the color from sceneWillEnterForeground when first start the app and then it stay for only couple seconds.
I can see the color from sceneDidEnterBackground when the app shows in the background.
Lastly, I can see the SceneWillResignActive in the simulator when app is closing and when going back to the background.
