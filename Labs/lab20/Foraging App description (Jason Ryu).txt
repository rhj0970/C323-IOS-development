For my app, the main function of the "Foraging App" is to create a virtual enviroment for a experiment room.
This app can provide virtual enviroment via smartphone and gives easier access to virtual experiment room.
One of the problem of the app would be the server. Since it need different client server to show different experiment room,
it requries client servers. However, I haven't learned it yet. So I hope I can fix this issue after I learn from class.
