To avoid a typical problem: write algorithms rather than loops in the model --> Model doesn't decide how the game goes...
sequence is necessary for the user-interaction. Model doesn't deal with it, or the user won't interact with the controller efficiently.


Even-Driving Programming:
basic 3 types:
Interactional algorithms - 323
Object-oriented algorithms - 322, 212
functional algorithms - 403, 343

Design the controller-->
Events
Reaction to events 
Event handler interaction with Model
What the sequence required to do interaction
Timeline!!

controller:

  Events:
  1. Start
  2. User input a number
  3. IBOutlet displays a Text(result given to view)
  4. User re inputs a number
  5. when user won
  6. User use restart


  Method:
  1--> displayRange() 
  1--> generateRandomNum
  2--> getNum/resetNum 4-->
  2--> compareNum  4-->
  2--> countSteps 4-->
  2--> disPlayResult -->4 & 4-->
  5--> displaySteps
  6--> initialization --> 1
  
  Variables:
  RangNum
  Generated number
  IBAction(to button): UserInputNum;
  IBOutlet: Output Text;
  
  
*IBOutlet -- connecting with view: set value to outlook
